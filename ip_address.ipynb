              "We’ve all been there. You’re five minutes late, the train is delayed, or the highway is a parking lot, and you find yourself wishing you could just *lift off* and fly over the chaos.\n",
              "\n",
              "Well, it looks like the solution might be sitting on a notepad right now.\n",

              "Here is why this sketch needs to become a reality immediately:\n",

              "**1. Stealth Mode Commuting**\n",
              "The biggest problem with traditional jetpacks? They are bulky and awkward. This design changes the game. It is lightweight and explicitly designed to **\"look like a normal backpack.\"** You can land outside your office building, retract the boosters, and walk in looking professional.\n",

              "**2. Practicality Meets Sci-Fi**\n",
              "It isn’t just for flying; it’s for working. The design features **padded strap support** for comfort and is spacious enough to **fit an 18\" laptop.** You can carry your mobile office *while* hovering 50 feet above the sidewalk.\n",
              "\n",
              "**3. Eco-Friendly Flight**\n",
              "Forget burning jet fuel. This concept is **steam-powered**, making it \"green and clean.\" Plus, in a nod to modern convenience, it features **USB-C charging**. Just plug it in next to your phone at night, and you’re ready for takeoff in the morning.\n",
              "\n",
              "**The Catch?**\n",
              "It has a **15-minute battery life**. It’s not going to get you across the country, but it is the perfect amount of time to skip that one terrible intersection or make a very dramatic entrance at a rooftop party.\n",
              "\n",
              "So, who is ready to invest? We aren't saying this is available in stores yet, but if it were, our commute would look a whole lot cooler.\n",

              "*   **Liftoff:** The transcript begins with the final countdown and liftoff from Cape Kennedy. The crew verifies roll and pitch programs, and the staging of the Saturn V rocket proceeds normally.\n",
              "*   **Earth Orbit to TLI:** After achieving Earth orbit, the crew checks systems before performing the Trans-Lunar Injection (TLI) burn to propel them toward the Moon.\n",
              "*   **Coasting:** The crew extracts the Lunar Module (Eagle) from the S-IVB stage and docks it with the Command Module (Columbia). The coasting phase involves routine navigation sightings (P23s), platform alignments (P52s), battery charging, and waste dumps.\n",
              "*   **TV Broadcasts:** The crew transmits television signals showing the receding Earth and the interior of the spacecraft.\n",
              "\n",
              "### 2. Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI)\n",
              "*   **Arrival:** The spacecraft fires the Service Propulsion System (SPS) engine to slow down and enter lunar orbit. The crew describes the lunar surface, noting craters like Taruntius and the Sea of Fertility.\n",
              "*   **Preparation:** Armstrong and Aldrin enter the Lunar Module (Eagle) to power it up and check systems. They discover a minor issue with a high-gain antenna but resolve it.\n",
              "\n",
              "### 3. Descent and Landing\n",
              "*   **Undocking:** Eagle separates from Columbia. Collins (CMP) visually inspects Eagle and gives them the \"Go.\"\n",
              "*   **Powered Descent:** This is a high-tension portion of the transcript. As Eagle descends, the computer triggers **1201 and 1202 program alarms** (indicating computer overload). Mission Control (Guidance Officer via CAP COMM) quickly confirms \"We're GO on that alarm,\" allowing the descent to continue.\n",
              "*   **Touchdown:** Armstrong takes manual control to avoid a rocky crater. Fuel runs low (\"60 seconds\"). Finally, Armstrong announces: **\"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.\"** Mission Control responds, \"You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again.\"\n",
              "\n",
              "### 4. Lunar Surface Operations (EVA)\n",

              "    *   They perform experiments: Solar Wind Composition, Passive Seismic Experiment, and Laser Ranging Retro-Reflector.\n",
              "    *   They collect bulk and documented soil/rock samples.\n",
              "    *   **Presidential Call:** President Richard Nixon speaks to the astronauts via telephone radio patch, calling it \"the most historic telephone call ever made.\"\n",
              "    *   They plant the US flag.\n",
              "*   **Ingress:** They load the sample boxes back into the LM, re-enter the spacecraft, repressurize, and discard their portable life support systems (PLSS) and trash onto the lunar surface to save weight.\n",
              "\n",
              "### 5. Ascent and Rendezvous\n",
              "*   **Liftoff:** After a rest period, Eagle’s ascent stage fires. Armstrong notes, \"The Eagle has wings.\"\n",
              "*   **Docking:** They perform a series of burns to rendezvous with Collins in Columbia. Docking is successful despite some minor oscillations.\n",
              "*   **Jettison:** The crew transfers samples and equipment to Columbia, then jettisons the Eagle ascent stage.\n",

              "### 6. Trans-Earth Coast\n",
              "*   **TEI:** The Service Module engine fires (Trans-Earth Injection) to bring them home.\n",
              "*   **Housekeeping:** The return trip is relatively quiet, consisting of P52 alignments, star checks, and a final TV broadcast where the crew thanks the American workforce.\n",
              "*   **News Updates:** Mission Control reads news from Earth to the crew, including the failure of the Soviet Luna 15 probe (which crashed into the moon) and the results of the MLB All-Star game.\n",

              "*   **Reentry:** The Command Module hits the atmosphere, entering a radio blackout period.\n",
              "*   **Splashdown:** Drogue chutes and main parachutes deploy successfully. The capsule splashes down in the Pacific Ocean. The crew confirms they are okay (\"Apollo 11 is out\"), and recovery forces (USS Hornet and Swim 1) move in.\n",

              "\n",
              "**Overview**\n",
              "*   **The Goal:** Google Research introduces a new technique (presented as \"Alchemist\" at CVPR 2024) that allows for the smooth, parametric editing of an object's material properties—such as color, roughness, metallic sheen, and transparency—within an existing photograph.\n",
              "*   **The Problem:** Previous methods typically required expert manual skills or struggled to maintain photorealism. Earlier generative AI models often failed to separate material look from geometric shape (e.g., changing a house's color might accidentally change its structure).\n",
              "\n",
              "**The Methodology**\n",
              "*   **Synthetic Data Training:** Instead of relying solely on real photos, the team used traditional computer graphics and physically based rendering to create a synthetic dataset. They generated images of 100 3D models where they could isolate and mathematically control specific material attributes.\n",
              "*   **Fine-Tuning Stable Diffusion:** They modified the architecture of Stable Diffusion 1.5 to accept a scalar \"edit strength\" value (ranging from -1 for minimum change to +1 for maximum change). The model was fine-tuned on the synthetic data to learn how to alter specific material properties while preserving the original context, lighting, and camera angle.\n",
              "\n",
              "**Key Capabilities & Results**\n",
              "*   **Parametric Control:** Users can input an edit strength to smoothly adjust attributes like \"metallic,\" \"roughness,\" or \"transparency.\"\n",
              "*   **Preservation of Geometry:** The model successfully changes the appearance of materials without distorting the object's original shape.\n",
              "*   **Advanced Rendering:** When making objects transparent, the model can realistically \"hallucinate\" and fill in the background behind the object, including complex lighting effects like refraction.\n",
              "*   **Performance:** In user studies, this method was strongly preferred over baseline methods (like InstructPix2Pix), with nearly 70% of users rating the results as more photorealistic.\n",
              "\n",
              "**Applications**\n",
              "*   **Design & Visualization:** The technology enables architects and designers to easily mock up changes, such as repainting a room or changing the material of a product prototype.\n",
              "*   **3D Reconstruction:** The method can be paired with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). By editing the input images of a scene, users can synthesize entirely new 3D views of a scene with altered materials."

              "\n",
              "**The Setup**\n",
              "The film opens in a vibrant, idyllic forest. A large, fat, and white rabbit (Big Buck Bunny) emerges from his burrow. He is portrayed as a gentle giant—stretching, smelling the flowers, and happily watching a butterfly land on his nose.\n",
              "\n",
              "**The Conflict**\n",
              "The peaceful scene is interrupted by three small, mischievous rodents: a squirrel (Frank), a flying squirrel (Rinky), and a chinchilla (Gamera). From a tree branch, they mock the bunny. When the bunny is admiring a butterfly, the rodents throw a piece of fruit at it, killing the butterfly instantly. They proceed to laugh hysterically and throw nuts and fruits at the bunny to bully him.\n",
              "\n",
              "**The Turning Point**\n",
              "The bunny initially tries to ignore them, but the rodents persist. They kill another butterfly and mock the bunny's shock. Finally, the bunny has had enough. His expression shifts from gentle to determined and angry. He grabs the branch the rodents are sitting on, but they escape.\n",
              "\n",
              "**The Preparation**\n",
              "The film shifts into a \"gear-up\" montage. The bunny prepares for revenge with tactical precision. He sharpens a stick into a spear, fashions a bow, sets up rope traps, and covers himself in mud for camouflage (though he immediately washes it off because he hates being dirty).\n",
              "\n",
              "**The Revenge**\n",
              "The bunny returns to face his bullies. He uses his size and his new traps to outsmart them one by one:\n",
              "*   He tricks the chinchilla into a hollow log, which he then sends rolling away.\n",
              "*   He captures the flying squirrel.\n",
              "*   He uses a bow and arrow to pin the leader squirrel against a tree by his ears and tail (without hurting him physically, just trapping him).\n",
              "\n",
              "**The Conclusion**\n",
              "The film ends with the bunny happily walking through a field. He is holding a string attached to the flying squirrel, whom he is now flying like a kite. As the credits roll, we see funny vignettes of the rodents enduring their punishments, including the trapped squirrel struggling on the tree and the bird from the beginning of the film landing on the gliding squirrel."

Hmmm... first, I'm parsing the clues. \"Moves but doesn't walk, run, or swim\" - that screams something with a fluid form of locomotion. Think creeping, flowing, or expanding. Right away, snails, amoebas, some plants, maybe even certain fungal structures and slime molds come to mind. Water and clouds are a long shot, since they are inanimate.\n",

It sounds like something like a single-celled organism or perhaps a syncytial structure, which throws some other potential candidates into the mix.\n",

        "\n",
        "[Gemini 3](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/gemini-3) models are our most capable model family to date and offers a stepwise improvement over Gemini 2.5 Pro. When migrating, consider the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Thinking:** If you were previously using complex prompt engineering (like Chain-of-thought) to force Gemini 2.5 to reason, try Gemini 3 with [`thinking_level: \"high\"`](#thinking_level) and simplified prompts (more in the [thinking](./Get_started_thinking.ipynb#gemini3migration) guide.   \n",
        "* **Temperature settings:** If your existing code explicitly sets temperature (especially to low values for deterministic outputs), we recommend removing this parameter and using the Gemini 3 default of 1.0 to avoid potential looping issues or performance degradation on complex tasks.  \n",
        "* **PDF & document understanding:** Default OCR resolution for PDFs has changed. If you relied on specific behavior for dense document parsing, test the new [`MEDIA_RESOLUTION_HIGH`](#media_resolution) setting to ensure continued accuracy.  \n",
        "* **Token consumption:** Migrating to Gemini 3 Pro defaults may **increase** token usage for PDFs but **decrease** token usage for video. If requests now exceed the context window due to higher default resolutions, we recommend explicitly reducing the [media resolution](#media_resolution).   \n",
        "* **Image segmentation:** Image segmentation capabilities (returning pixel-level masks for objects) are not supported in Gemini 3 Pro. For workloads requiring native image segmentation, we recommend continuing to utilize Gemini 2.5 Flash with thinking turned off (cf. [Spatial understanding guide ![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/images/colab_icon16.png)](./Spatial_understanding.ipynb)) or [Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 ![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/images/colab_icon16.png)](./gemini-robotics-er.ipynb)."
